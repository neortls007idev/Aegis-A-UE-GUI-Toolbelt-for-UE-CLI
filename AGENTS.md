## Scope
This file governs the entire repository.

## Instructions
- Use Python 3.11 or newer.
- Format code with `black` and lint with `ruff`.
- Run `ruff .` and `black --check .` before committing. If `black` flags files you didn't touch, you may leave them for a dedicated formatting PR.
- Run `pytest` and ensure tests pass.
- Avoid using `shell=True` in subprocess calls.
